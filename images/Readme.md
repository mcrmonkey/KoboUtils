KoboUtils - Images
==================

Utils to help you create custom raw files for use on your kobo e-reader device.

Use at your own risk



1. Create png image in gimp 800x600 big.
2. draw your picture
3. grayscale it ( image -> mode -> grayscale )
4. export it as a png.
5. use png2raw to make the conversion. This also details the addition of the extra info at the end of the script.





Please note:
------------
These scripts are not yet complete. To use them you will need to replace "IN" and "OUT" in the ffmpeg line with your raw file and png output or vice versa



TODO:
-----
Make the scripts take options from cmdline
